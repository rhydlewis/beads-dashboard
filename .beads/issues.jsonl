Teams need to understand:\n- Is delivery capability improving, declining, or stable over time?\n- What's the sustainable delivery rate for forecasting?\n- Did a process change positively or negatively impact throughput?\n- Is the daily variation normal or concerning?\n\nA rolling average smooths out daily noise and reveals the underlying trend, which is essential for capacity planning and continuous improvement.\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n1. Team lead reviews 30-day throughput trend before sprint planning to set realistic commitments\n2. After implementing pair programming, team tracks whether 14-day average is increasing\n3.

SLEs transform cycle time data into commitments teams can make to stakeholders:\n- \"We resolve critical bugs within 24 hours, 90% of the time\"\n- \"Features are typically delivered within 2 weeks\"\n\nWithout SLEs, teams can't answer \"are we meeting expectations?\" and stakeholders can't rely on delivery timelines. SLEs also enable proactive alerts when items are aging toward a breach.\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n1. Team defines SLE: \"85% of P0 bugs closed within 24h\" — dashboard shows current performance is 78%, highlighting the gap\n2. Support manager sees 3 bugs approaching their 24h SLE deadline and escalates\n3. Product owner shares SLE performance report showing 92% of features delivered within sprint\n4.

Typical teams have 15-40% flow efficiency, meaning 60-85% of cycle time is waste (waiting).\n\nThis metric:\n- Shifts focus from \"work faster\" to \"reduce wait time\"\n- Identifies where work stalls in the process\n- Provides a single health metric for flow\n- Enables before/after comparison for process improvements\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n1. Team discovers flow efficiency is 20%, meaning items wait 4x longer than they're worked on\n2. After reducing handoffs, team tracks flow efficiency improving from 22% to 35%\n3. Manager compares flow efficiency across different issue types (bugs vs features)\n4. During retro, team identifies \"blocked\" status as the biggest efficiency killer\n\n**Implementation Requirements:**\n- Define active statuses: `in_progress` (configurable, could include others)\n- Define waiting statuses: `open`, `blocked`, `deferred` (configurable)\n- Calculate time spent in each status from issue history (requires status change timestamps)\n- Note: This may require Beads schema/API to expose status change history\n- If history unavailable, calculate based on current state and created date as approximation\n- Create `FlowEfficiencyGauge` component showing overall percentage\n- Create `FlowEfficiencyTrend` chart showing efficiency over time (weekly rolling)\n- Create `FlowEfficiencyByStatus` breakdown showing time in each status\n- Calculate per-issue efficiency for completed items\n- Show distribution of flow efficiency across items (histogram)\n\n**Required Unit Tests:**\n- Active time calculated correctly from status history\n- Wait time calculated correctly from status history\n- Flow efficiency percentage calculated correctly (active / total)\n- Handles issues with no active time (0% efficiency)\n- Handles issues with no wait time (100% efficiency)\n- Overall efficiency aggregates correctly across multiple issues\n- Trend calculation groups by correct time periods\n- Status breakdown sums to 100% of cycle time\n- Fallback calculation works when history unavailable\n- Per-issue efficiency calculated and displayed correctly","design":"**Flow Efficiency Gauge:**\n- Prominent card/widget placement\n- Circular gauge or large percentage display\n- Color coding: red (\u003c25%), yellow (25-50%), green (\u003e50%)\n- Comparison to previous period: \"↑ 5% from last month\"\n\n**Efficiency Trend Chart:**\n- Line chart with flow efficiency percentage on Y-axis\n- Time on X-axis (weekly data points recommended)\n- Reference lines at key thresholds (25%, 50%)\n- Tooltip shows week dates and efficiency value\n\n**Status Time Breakdown:**\n- Horizontal stacked bar or donut chart\n- Segments for each status, sized by total time spent\n- Active statuses in green tones, waiting in yellow/red tones\n- Legend with status names and percentages\n\n**Per-Issue Efficiency:**\n- Optional column in table view\n- Small efficiency badge on issue cards\n- Histogram showing distribution of flow efficiency across completed items","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Dashboard displays overall flow efficiency as a percentage\n- [ ] Flow efficiency trend is visualized over time (weekly or configurable period)\n- [ ] Breakdown shows time distribution across different statuses (active vs waiting)\n- [ ] Flow efficiency is color-coded to indicate health (red/yellow/green thresholds)\n- [ ] Individual completed issues show their flow efficiency metrics\n- [ ] Configuration allows customizing which statuses count as \"active\" vs \"waiting\"\n```","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-15T18:03:47.014806Z","updated_at":"2026-01-15T18:03:47.014806Z"}

{"id":"beads-dashboard-hsj","title":"Kanban Board View","description":"Implement a drag-and-drop Kanban board view that displays work items as cards organized into columns based on their workflow status (open, in_progress, blocked, done, etc.).\n\n**Why it's needed:**\nThe current table view is excellent for data analysis but doesn't provide the tactile, spatial workflow interaction that teams expect for daily work management. A Kanban board is the industry-standard visualization for lean/agile workflows and is essential for:\n- Daily standups where teams need to quickly see work state\n- Moving work through the pipeline with immediate visual feedback\n- Understanding WIP at a glance per status column\n- Identifying bottlenecks visually (columns with too many cards)\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n1. A developer opens the dashboard for morning standup, switches to Board view, and drags their \"Login API refactor\" card from \"In Progress\" to \"Done\"\n2. A team lead glances at the board and immediately sees 8 cards stuck in \"Blocked\" column, triggering a conversation about impediments\n3. During planning, the team drags new items from \"Open\" to \"In Progress\" while respecting WIP limits shown on each column\n\n**Implementation Requirements:**\n- Create a new `KanbanBoard` component that fetches issues grouped by status\n- Each column represents a workflow status from the Beads schema (open, in_progress, blocked, deferred, done, tombstone)\n- Cards display: title, issue ID, priority indicator, assignee avatar/initials, age badge (colored by current aging rules)\n- Drag-and-drop functionality updates the issue status via the Beads API\n- Column headers show: status name, card count, optional WIP limit indicator\n- Cards should be clickable to open issue details (reuse existing detail view)\n- Support touch devices for drag operations\n- Persist view preference (table vs board) in localStorage\n\n**Required Unit Tests:**\n- `KanbanBoard` renders correct number of columns for all workflow statuses\n- Issues are correctly grouped into their respective status columns\n- Dragging a card between columns triggers status update API call with correct parameters\n- Card displays all required fields (title, ID, priority, assignee, age)\n- Age badge color matches existing aging rules (green \u003c 7d, orange \u003c 30d, red \u003e 30d)\n- Empty columns render with appropriate empty state\n- WIP count updates immediately after drag operation (optimistic update)\n- Failed drag operation reverts card to original column and shows error","design":"**Layout:**\n- Horizontal scrolling container with fixed-width columns (280-320px)\n- Columns ordered by workflow progression: Open → In Progress → Blocked → Done → Deferred → Tombstone\n- Sticky column headers that remain visible when scrolling vertically within a column\n\n**Card Design:**\n- Compact card height (~80-100px) to maximize visible cards\n- Visual hierarchy: Title (bold, truncate with ellipsis) \u003e ID + Priority \u003e Assignee + Age\n- Priority indicator: colored left border or badge (P0=red, P1=orange, P2=yellow, P3=blue, P4=gray)\n- Subtle shadow on hover, elevated shadow while dragging\n- Drop zone highlight when dragging over valid columns\n\n**Interactions:**\n- Cursor changes to \"grab\" on card hover, \"grabbing\" while dragging\n- Semi-transparent \"ghost\" card follows cursor during drag\n- Invalid drop zones (if any) show visual rejection indicator\n- Smooth animation when cards reorder within columns\n\n**Responsive Behavior:**\n- On narrow screens (\u003c768px), show horizontal scroll with snap points\n- Consider a mobile-optimized single-column view with status tabs","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] User can view all issues organized into columns by workflow status\n- [ ] User can drag a card from one column to another and the issue status updates in the database\n- [ ] Cards display title, ID, priority, assignee, and color-coded age indicator\n- [ ] Board view persists as user preference when switching away and returning\n- [ ] Drag and drop works on both mouse and touch devices\n- [ ] Column shows accurate count of cards and updates in real-time\n\n---","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-15T18:03:47.009925Z","updated_at":"2026-01-15T18:03:47.009925Z"}

Filters should be combinable and instantly update all dashboard views.\n\n**Why it's needed:**\nCurrently, users must manually search or scan through all issues to find specific subsets. This is time-consuming and error-prone, especially as the issue count grows. Quick filters provide:\n- Instant access to common queries (\"show me my P1 bugs\")\n- Discoverable filtering without learning search syntax\n- Visual indication of active filters\n- Combinable filters for complex queries (Assignee=me AND Priority=1 AND Type=bug)\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n1. Developer clicks their name in the Assignee filter to see only their assigned work\n2. QA engineer combines Type=bug + Priority=0 to focus on critical bugs\n3. Team lead clicks \"In Progress\" status + \"Blocked\" to find stuck work\n4. User clicks a label \"frontend\" to see all frontend-related issues\n\n**Implementation Requirements:**\n- Create `FilterSidebar` component with collapsible sections for each facet\n- Facet sections: Status, Assignee, Priority (0-4), Type (bug, feature, task, chore), Labels\n- Each facet shows available values with issue counts (e.g., \"Alice (5)\", \"Bug (12)\")\n- Clicking a value toggles it as an active filter\n- Multiple selections within a facet use OR logic (Priority 1 OR 2)\n- Selections across facets use AND logic (Priority 1 AND Type=bug)\n- Active filters shown as removable chips above the main content\n- \"Clear all filters\" button when any filter is active\n- Filter state syncs to URL query parameters (for shareability)\n- Filters apply to all views: Table, Charts, and Kanban board\n\n**Required Unit Tests:**\n- `FilterSidebar` renders all facet sections with correct values from data\n- Facet values show accurate issue counts\n- Clicking a filter value adds it to active filters\n- Clicking an active filter value removes it\n- Multiple filters within same facet combine with OR logic\n- Filters across different facets combine with AND logic\n- Active filter chips render correctly and are removable\n- \"Clear all\" button resets all filters\n- URL updates when filters change\n- Page load with filter query params applies filters correctly\n- Filtered data propagates to table view correctly\n- Filtered data propagates to chart components correctly","design":"**Layout:**\n- Left sidebar, 240-280px width, collapsible to icon-only (48px) on user toggle\n- Each facet section has header with expand/collapse chevron\n- Facet values as list items or horizontal chip groups depending on count\n\n**Visual Design:**\n- Active filters highlighted with primary color background\n- Count badges right-aligned, muted color\n- Facet sections with subtle separators\n- \"Clear all\" link/button in filters header area\n\n**Active Filter Chips:**\n- Horizontal row above main content area\n- Each chip shows \"Facet: Value\" with X to remove\n- Chips wrap to multiple lines if many active\n\n**States:**\n- Empty facet (no values): hide section or show \"None\" disabled\n- Zero-count values: show but visually muted, still clickable\n- Loading state: skeleton loaders for counts during data fetch\n\n**Responsive:**\n- On mobile, filters collapse to a modal/drawer triggered by filter icon button\n- Filter chips remain visible in a horizontally scrollable row","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Sidebar displays filter options for Status, Assignee, Priority, Type, and Labels\n- [ ] Each filter option shows the count of matching issues\n- [ ] Clicking a filter immediately updates the displayed issues in all views\n- [ ] Multiple filters can be combined (AND across facets, OR within facets)\n- [ ] Active filters are displayed as removable chips\n- [ ] Filter state is reflected in the URL and shareable via link\n- [ ] Filters persist when switching between Table, Board, and Chart views\n\n---","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-15T18:03:47.011024Z","updated_at":"2026-01-15T18:03:47.011024Z"}
