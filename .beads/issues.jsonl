{"id":"beads-dashboard-05b","title":"Issue View Modal with Tabbed Editing","description":"Expand the existing `openDescription()` modal into a full issue view with three editable tabs: Description, Design, and Acceptance Tests. All three fields should be viewable and editable within the modal.\n\n**Why it's needed:**\nThe current modal only shows the description field, but issues in Beads have richer content including design notes and acceptance criteria. Users need to:\n- View all issue context without leaving the current view\n- Edit any field without navigating to a separate page\n- Quickly switch between related content (description → design → acceptance)\n- Maintain context while reviewing different aspects of an issue\n\nThis reduces friction for issue refinement and review workflows.\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n1. Developer opens issue modal, reads description, switches to Acceptance tab to understand done criteria\n2. Product owner edits acceptance tests directly in modal during backlog refinement\n3. Designer updates the Design tab with UI notes without losing their place in the table\n4. During standup, team reviews all three tabs of a complex issue to clarify scope\n\n**Implementation Requirements:**\n- Refactor `openDescription()` modal to `IssueViewModal` component\n- Implement tab navigation with three tabs: \"Description\", \"Design\", \"Acceptance\"\n- Each tab displays corresponding field content with Markdown rendering (read mode)\n- Each tab has an \"Edit\" button or toggle to switch to edit mode\n- Edit mode shows textarea with raw Markdown content\n- Save and Cancel buttons in edit mode\n- Save triggers API update for the specific field\n- Optimistic update with error rollback\n- Preserve tab state when switching between read/edit modes\n- Modal header shows issue ID and title (editable title as stretch goal)\n- Close modal with Escape key, click outside, or X button\n- Keyboard navigation between tabs (arrow keys or Ctrl+Tab)\n- Unsaved changes warning if user attempts to close with edits pending\n\n**Required Unit Tests:**\n- Modal renders with three tabs visible\n- Clicking each tab displays correct field content\n- Description tab shows issue description with Markdown rendered\n- Design tab shows issue design field with Markdown rendered\n- Acceptance tab shows issue acceptance field with Markdown rendered\n- Edit button switches tab to edit mode with textarea\n- Textarea contains raw Markdown content for editing\n- Save button triggers API call with updated content\n- Cancel button reverts to read mode without saving\n- Optimistic update shows new content immediately\n- Failed save shows error and reverts content\n- Close attempts with unsaved changes shows confirmation\n- Escape key closes modal (when no unsaved changes)\n- Empty fields display appropriate placeholder/empty state","design":"**Modal Layout:**\n- Width: 600-800px (responsive, narrower on mobile)\n- Height: auto with max-height and scroll\n- Header: Issue ID badge + Title (left), Close X button (right)\n- Tab bar: immediately below header, full width\n- Content area: below tabs, scrollable if content exceeds height\n- Footer: contextual (shows Save/Cancel in edit mode)\n\n**Tab Design:**\n- Horizontal tabs: \"Description\" | \"Design\" | \"Acceptance\"\n- Active tab: bold text, underline or background highlight\n- Inactive tabs: regular weight, muted color\n- Tab icons optional: 📝 Description, 🎨 Design, ✅ Acceptance\n\n**Read Mode:**\n- Rendered Markdown content with proper styling (headers, lists, code blocks)\n- \"Edit\" button positioned top-right of content area (pencil icon + \"Edit\")\n- Empty state: \"No [description/design/acceptance criteria] provided.

Teams need to understand:\n- Is delivery capability improving, declining, or stable over time?\n- What's the sustainable delivery rate for forecasting?\n- Did a process change positively or negatively impact throughput?\n- Is the daily variation normal or concerning?\n\nA rolling average smooths out daily noise and reveals the underlying trend, which is essential for capacity planning and continuous improvement.\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n1. Team lead reviews 30-day throughput trend before sprint planning to set realistic commitments\n2. After implementing pair programming, team tracks whether 14-day average is increasing\n3.

SLEs transform cycle time data into commitments teams can make to stakeholders:\n- \"We resolve critical bugs within 24 hours, 90% of the time\"\n- \"Features are typically delivered within 2 weeks\"\n\nWithout SLEs, teams can't answer \"are we meeting expectations?\" and stakeholders can't rely on delivery timelines. SLEs also enable proactive alerts when items are aging toward a breach.\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n1. Team defines SLE: \"85% of P0 bugs closed within 24h\" — dashboard shows current performance is 78%, highlighting the gap\n2.

{"id":"beads-dashboard-hsj","title":"Kanban Board View","description":"Implement a drag-and-drop Kanban board view that displays work items as cards organized into columns based on their workflow status (open, in_progress, blocked, done, etc.). The board should provide at-a-glance visibility into the state of work across multiple coding agents.\n\n**Why it's needed:**\nThe current table view is excellent for data analysis but doesn't provide the spatial, real-time workflow visibility that engineers need when supervising multiple coding agents. A Kanban board is essential for agent oversight because:\n- Engineers can instantly see what each agent is working on and identify stuck agents without reading through logs\n- Visual clustering reveals when too many tasks are piling up in a particular state (e.g., multiple agents blocked waiting for review)\n- Quick intervention is possible—dragging a stuck task back to \"Open\" to reassign it to a different agent takes one gesture\n- WIP limits per column help engineers avoid overloading the system with too many concurrent agent tasks\n- The spatial layout maps naturally to the mental model of \"agents working in parallel on different tasks\"\n\nWhen managing 3-5+ coding agents simultaneously, a table requires cognitive effort to parse. A board lets you pattern-match instantly: \"Two cards in Blocked, five in Progress, one aging red—I need to check on that blocked work.\"\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n1. Engineer starts their day, opens the Board view, and immediately sees one agent's task has been \"In Progress\" for 6 hours (red age badge)—investigates and finds the agent stuck in a loop\n2. During async check-in, engineer glances at board and sees healthy flow: cards moving steadily from Open → In Progress → Done\n3. Engineer spots an agent has 3 cards in \"In Progress\" simultaneously (violating single-task focus), investigates the agent's configuration\n4. WIP limit indicator shows \"In Progress: 5/5\"—engineer knows not to assign new work until agents complete current tasks\n5. Engineer filters board to single agent's work to review that agent's throughput and identify if it's consistently slower than others\n\n**Implementation Requirements:**\n- Create a new `KanbanBoard` component that fetches issues grouped by status\n- Each column represents a workflow status from the Beads schema (open, in_progress, blocked, deferred, done, tombstone)\n- Cards display: title, issue ID, priority indicator, assignee (agent name or human), age badge (colored by aging rules—hours for agents, days for humans)\n- Assignee display should distinguish agents from humans visually (e.g., robot icon vs avatar, or configurable agent name patterns)\n- Drag-and-drop functionality updates the issue status via the Beads API\n- Column headers show: status name, card count, WIP limit indicator (if configured)\n- Cards should be clickable to open issue details (reuse existing detail view)\n- Support filtering board by assignee to focus on single agent's work\n- Support touch devices for drag operations\n- Persist view preference (table vs board) in localStorage\n- Consider \"swim lanes\" by assignee as a future enhancement for multi-agent visibility\n\n**Required Unit Tests:**\n- `KanbanBoard` renders correct number of columns for all workflow statuses\n- Issues are correctly grouped into their respective status columns\n- Dragging a card between columns triggers status update API call with correct parameters\n- Card displays all required fields (title, ID, priority, assignee, age)\n- Assignee field correctly identifies and displays agent vs human assignees\n- Age badge color matches aging rules (hour-based thresholds: green \u003c 2h, orange \u003c 4h, red \u003e 4h for agent work)\n- Age badge displays appropriate time format (hours/minutes for recent, days for older)\n- Empty columns render with appropriate empty state\n- WIP count updates immediately after drag operation (optimistic update)\n- WIP limit warning displays when column count meets or exceeds limit\n- Failed drag operation reverts card to original column and shows error\n- Filtering by assignee shows only that assignee's cards\n- Board correctly updates in real-time when underlying data changes (agent completes work)","design":"**Layout:**\n- Horizontal scrolling container with fixed-width columns (280-320px)\n- Columns ordered by workflow progression: Open → In Progress → Blocked → Done → Deferred → Tombstone\n- Sticky column headers that remain visible when scrolling vertically within a column\n\n**Card Design:**\n- Compact card height (~80-100px) to maximize visible cards\n- Visual hierarchy: Title (bold, truncate with ellipsis) \u003e ID + Priority \u003e Assignee + Age\n- Priority indicator: colored left border or badge (P0=red, P1=orange, P2=yellow, P3=blue, P4=gray)\n- Subtle shadow on hover, elevated shadow while dragging\n- Drop zone highlight when dragging over valid columns\n\n**Interactions:**\n- Cursor changes to grab on card hover, grabbing while dragging\n- Semi-transparent ghost card follows cursor during drag\n- Invalid drop zones (if any) show visual rejection indicator\n- Smooth animation when cards reorder within columns\n\n**Responsive Behavior:**\n- On narrow screens (\u003c768px), show horizontal scroll with snap points\n- Consider a mobile-optimized single-column view with status tabs","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] User can view all issues organized into columns by workflow status\n- [ ] User can drag a card from one column to another and the issue status updates in the database\n- [ ] Cards display title, ID, priority, and color-coded age indicator\n- [ ] Assignee is displayed with visual distinction between agents and human users\n- [ ] Column shows accurate card count and WIP limit warning if limit exceeded\n- [ ] Board view persists as user preference when switching away and returning\n- [ ] Drag and drop works on both mouse and touch devices","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-15T18:03:47.009925Z","updated_at":"2026-01-16T16:06:09.969753Z","closed_at":"2026-01-16T16:06:09.969753Z","close_reason":"Feature complete and merged to main.

This is time-consuming and error-prone, especially as the issue count grows. Quick filters provide:\n- Instant access to common queries (\"show me my P1 bugs\")\n- Discoverable filtering without learning search syntax\n- Visual indication of active filters\n- Combinable filters for complex queries (Assignee=me AND Priority=1 AND Type=bug)\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n1.

{"id":"beads-dashboard-spt","title":"Aging WIP Alerts and Thresholds","description":"Implement a configurable alert system that highlights work items exceeding age thresholds, with prominent dashboard placement and proactive notifications for at-risk items. Thresholds should support both hour-based and day-based granularity to accommodate fast-moving agent workflows.\n\n**Why it's needed:**\nThe existing Aging WIP scatterplot shows item ages with color coding, but engineers overseeing coding agents need:\n- Fine-grained thresholds in hours (4h, 8h, 24h) because agents can complete many tasks within a single workday\n- Early warning when an agent's task is taking longer than expected—often a sign the agent is stuck, looping, or blocked\n- A dedicated view for items needing human intervention so engineers can quickly identify where to step in\n- Visual prominence so stalled agent work doesn't silently accumulate while the engineer focuses elsewhere\n\nWhen supervising multiple coding agents, a task aging beyond expected bounds is a critical signal. It often means the agent has hit an edge case, is waiting on input, or has encountered an error state. Traditional day-based thresholds (7/30 days) are far too slow—by the time a task is days old in an agent workflow, significant time and compute have been wasted.\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n1. Engineer configures thresholds: warning at 4 hours, critical at 8 hours for agent-assigned tasks\n2. Dashboard header shows badge: \"2 items critical, 5 items warning\"—engineer immediately knows agents need attention\n3. Engineer sees an agent's task highlighted red after 6 hours, investigates and finds the agent stuck in a retry loop\n4. During daily review, engineer scans the aging alert list and reassigns a stuck task to a different agent or takes it over manually\n5. Team uses different thresholds for agent work (hours) vs human work (days) based on assignee type\n6. Engineer spots a pattern: tasks involving legacy API consistently age out, indicating a systemic blocker to address\n\n**Implementation Requirements:**\n- Create `AgingThresholdConfig` component for setting thresholds\n- Thresholds support both hours and days with unit selector (e.g., \"4 hours\" or \"2 days\")\n- Granularity options: 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h, and custom day values\n- Configurable \"warning\" and \"critical\" thresholds (defaults: 4 hours and 8 hours for agent context)\n- Option to set different thresholds by assignee type (agent vs human) or label\n- Option to auto-calculate from percentiles (e.g., P85 and P95 of historical cycle time)\n- Store configuration in localStorage\n- Create `AgingAlertBadge` component for dashboard header showing count of items at each level\n- Create `AgingAlertList` component showing all items exceeding warning threshold\n- List sorted by age (oldest first), shows: title, ID, age (in appropriate units), assignee, status\n- Age display adapts to magnitude: \"3h 24m\" for recent, \"2.5 days\" for older items\n- Integrate aging indicators into Table View rows and Kanban cards\n- Row/card background tint or border color based on aging status\n- Filter quick-action to show only aging items\n- Optional: filter to show only agent-assigned aging items vs human-assigned\n\n**Required Unit Tests:**\n- Threshold configuration saves and loads correctly with hour-based values\n- Threshold configuration saves and loads correctly with day-based values\n- Hour-to-millisecond conversion calculates correctly for comparisons\n- Items correctly classified: normal (below warning), warning (between warning and critical), critical (above critical)\n- Classification works correctly for hour-based thresholds (e.g., 4h warning, 8h critical)\n- Classification works correctly for day-based thresholds\n- Auto-calculate from percentiles returns correct threshold values\n- Alert badge shows correct counts for each level\n- Alert list includes all items above warning threshold\n- Alert list sorted by age descending (oldest first)\n- Age display shows hours/minutes for items under 24 hours\n- Age display shows days for items over 24 hours\n- Table row styling applies correct class based on aging status\n- Kanban card styling applies correct class based on aging status\n- Items at exactly threshold boundary classified correctly\n- Aging calculations use correct date field (created_at or status change)\n- Different thresholds per assignee type applies correctly (if implemented)","design":"**Configuration Panel:**\n- Accessible from settings/gear icon\n- Threshold inputs: Warning and Critical values\n- Unit selector: 'Hours' or 'Days' for each threshold (or global toggle)\n- Toggle for 'Auto-calculate from historical data' with percentile dropdowns\n- Preview showing how many current items fall into each bucket\n\n**Alert Badge (Header):**\n- Position: dashboard header, right side near notifications\n- Compact display: icon + count, expandable on click\n- Color-coded: yellow background for warnings only, red if any critical\n- Click expands to dropdown list of affected items\n\n**Aging Alert List:**\n- Dedicated section or tab in dashboard\n- Table format: Issue, Age, Threshold Status, Assignee, Status\n- Row backgrounds: light yellow (warning), light red (critical)\n- 'Age' column shows both value and relative description ('12h - critical' or '3 days - warning')\n\n**Table/Card Integration:**\n- Subtle left border or background tint (not overwhelming)\n- Warning: soft yellow/amber tint\n- Critical: soft red/pink tint\n- Consistent colors across Table, Board, and Alert views","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] User can configure warning and critical age thresholds in either hours or days\n- [ ] Dashboard header displays count of items in warning and critical states\n- [ ] Dedicated view/list shows all aging items sorted by age\n- [ ] Table view rows are visually highlighted based on aging status\n- [ ] Kanban board cards are visually highlighted based on aging status\n- [ ] Threshold configuration persists across sessions","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-15T18:03:47.012941Z","updated_at":"2026-01-16T16:54:32.7303Z"}
{"id":"beads-dashboard-tcc","title":"Quick Change Priority","description":"Add inline priority adjustment controls (up/down arrows) next to the priority badge in the issues table, allowing users to quickly increment or decrement an issue's priority without opening a modal or detail view.\n\n**Why it's needed:**\nPriority adjustments are one of the most common actions during backlog grooming and triage. Currently, changing priority requires:\n1. Opening the issue detail view\n2. Finding the priority field\n3. Selecting a new value\n4. Saving and closing\n\nThis friction discourages quick prioritization decisions. Inline controls enable:\n- Rapid triage during review sessions\n- Easy reordering during standups\n- Quick adjustments as priorities shift\n- Efficient bulk-style prioritization without formal bulk actions\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n1. During triage, product owner rapidly promotes several bugs from P3 to P2 using up arrows\n2. Developer demotes a P1 feature to P2 as more urgent work arrives—single click\n3. Team reviews table sorted by priority and adjusts outliers inline during grooming\n4. New urgent issue arrives; user quickly promotes it to P0 with two up-arrow clicks\n\n**Implementation Requirements:**\n- Add `PriorityQuickChange` component to priority cell in issues table\n- Display current priority badge with up/down arrow buttons flanking it\n- Up arrow: decreases priority number (higher priority: P3 → P2 → P1 → P0)\n- Down arrow: increases priority number (lower priority: P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 → P4)\n- Disable up arrow when priority is already P0 (highest)\n- Disable down arrow when priority is already P4 (lowest)\n- Click triggers immediate API update (optimistic update pattern)\n- Visual feedback during save (subtle loading state or brief highlight)\n- Error handling: revert to original value and show error toast on failure\n- Arrows visible on row hover only (to reduce visual noise) OR always visible (configurable)\n- Keyboard support: when row/cell focused, up/down arrow keys adjust priority\n- Ensure click targets are large enough for reliable clicking (min 24x24px)\n\n**Required Unit Tests:**\n- Up arrow decreases priority value (P3 → P2)\n- Down arrow increases priority value (P2 → P3)\n- Up arrow disabled when priority is P0\n- Down arrow disabled when priority is P4\n- Click triggers API update with correct new priority value\n- Optimistic update shows new priority immediately\n- Failed update reverts priority and shows error\n- Arrows appear on row hover (if hover-only mode)\n- Keyboard up arrow decreases priority when cell focused\n- Keyboard down arrow increases priority when cell focused\n- Priority badge updates to reflect new value and color\n- Rapid clicks are debounced or queued appropriately","design":"**Layout:**\n- Priority cell contains: [↑] [Priority Badge] [↓]\n- Arrows positioned immediately adjacent to badge\n- Compact spacing to fit within table cell without expanding column width\n\n**Arrow Buttons:**\n- Small, subtle arrow icons (chevron-up, chevron-down)\n- Size: 20-24px clickable area, icon itself ~12-14px\n- Default state: muted/gray color\n- Hover state: primary color, slight scale or background\n- Disabled state: very muted, cursor not-allowed, no hover effect\n- Active/click state: brief press effect\n\n**Visibility Options:**\n- Option A (Hover): arrows invisible by default, appear on row hover\n  - Cleaner table appearance, less visual noise\n  - May be less discoverable\n- Option B (Always): arrows always visible but very subtle\n  - More discoverable, consistent muscle memory\n  - Slightly busier table appearance\n- Recommend starting with hover-reveal, making it configurable later\n\n**Priority Badge:**\n- Existing badge design (colored by priority level)\n- Badge should remain clickable to open full edit (if that exists)\n- Or badge click could cycle priority (alternative to arrows)\n\n**Feedback States:**\n- Saving: brief opacity reduction or spinner overlay on badge\n- Success: subtle flash/highlight (green tint, 200ms)\n- Error: shake animation + red flash + error toast\n\n**Keyboard Interaction:**\n- Tab navigates to priority cell\n- Up/Down arrow keys adjust priority\n- Visual focus indicator on cell when keyboard-focused\n- Arrow buttons themselves not in tab order (arrows are mouse/touch convenience)\n\n**Responsive:**\n- On touch devices, arrows should always be visible (no hover)\n- Ensure touch targets meet minimum size (44x44px recommended for mobile)\n- Consider swipe gestures as alternative on mobile (swipe right = promote, left = demote)","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Up and down arrow buttons appear next to the priority badge in table rows\n- [ ] Clicking up arrow increases priority (lower number, e.g., P3 → P2)\n- [ ] Clicking down arrow decreases priority (higher number, e.g., P2 → P3)\n- [ ] Up arrow is disabled when issue is already highest priority (P0)\n- [ ] Down arrow is disabled when issue is already lowest priority (P4)\n- [ ] Priority changes are saved immediately without requiring a modal or confirmation\n- [ ] Visual feedback confirms the save (or shows error if save fails)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-15T19:12:28.523342Z","updated_at":"2026-01-15T22:07:28.083211Z","closed_at":"2026-01-15T22:07:28.083211Z","close_reason":"Closed"}
